It was drawing class. The kids loved drawing, so each kid opened their notebooks and started scrbbling. The teacher shouted at everyone to wait. Once everyone were ready, she asked them to start. The kids were overjoyed and started drawing random crazy things. Looking at the madness, she again shouted at everyone to wait, and gave them a theme - a mountain.</p>
<p>Kids went crazy again drawing all shapes that looked nothing like a mountain. Teacher again intervened, asked them to wait, now she drew a perfect mountain and asked them draw the same way. Ofcourse, many kids didnt get it, but they were asked to redo untl they got it right. Teacher was finally happy and said &quot;its coloring time&quot;.
Kids loved coloring, they started painting and coloring like crazy. Teacher looked at mountains that were pink, orange, neon, aqua blue, etc and was disappointed. She sighed and shouted again asking them to stop and then asked them to all color brown.</p>
<p>This went on for all different subjects. At the end of the year, they were all well disciplined, talented and wise, just like the teacher. Exactly 26 years later, coincidently all of the 18 kids were engineers hard working in IT, different companies and all were looking for help in Google to do their work.</p>
<p>P.S. And one girl, who then drew the pink mountain, logged into chatGPT.</p>
