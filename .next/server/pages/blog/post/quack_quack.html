on my first day at school</p>
<p>Made friends with a rabbit, a pigeon
a dog and a fish</p>
<p>There were 4 fun classes each day,
jumping, running, flying and my favourite swimming.</p>
<p>We had to take an average of 40 to pass,
I flunked, got 90 in swimming, and less than 20 in others.</p>
<p>Everyone failed the exams except the dog,
Who got an average of 60, I dont know how he did it.</p>
<p>Over the years, I trained hard on running class,
I skipped swmming, as I was the best at it.</p>
<p>Today, 12 years later, I am proud to say, I passed out
With 44, dog was the highest with 62.</p>
<p>Rabbit passed with 60, pigeon broke few bones, but did pass out.
Fish dropped out, he is doing well though in his own pond.</p>
<p>Little sad I only got 50 in swimming, as I broke my webbed feet
But still the best in swimming class, quacked happily my way out.</p>
