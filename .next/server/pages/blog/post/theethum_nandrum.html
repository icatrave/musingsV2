<p>Story 2</p>
<p>On a cold winter in suburbs of Seattle, WA, there were swarm of police cars outside a hotel bar. The ambulances were already lined up taking in young kids on a stretcher. The Detective just came in to check on the situation.</p>
<p>Officer: Sir, there were 14 kids in total, all students of UW. And all except one girl, are drugged in their drinks, likely ketamine. We were questioning the bartender and the owner.</p>
<p>Detective: What? except one? who is that?
Officer: That girl over there, she was the one who called us.</p>
<p>Detective: Interesting. (looks at the bartender) What did she drink?
Bartender: She wasnt let in, sir. She is underage.</p>
<p>Detective: Nonsense, arent all these kids underage. Dont act like you dont know that.
Bartender: Sir, we just check for ids, if they are above 18 we let them.</p>
<p>Officer calls that girl for questioning and after all the questions, the Detective looks at her.</p>
<p>Detective: Why didnt you get a fake id? Didnt your friends get one for you too?
The Girl: No, sir. It felt wrong.</p>
