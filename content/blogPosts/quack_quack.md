Was quacking all day happily
on my first day at school

Made friends with a rabbit, a pigeon
a dog and a fish

There were 4 fun classes each day,
jumping, running, flying and my favourite swimming.

We had to take an average of 40 to pass,
I flunked, got 90 in swimming, and less than 20 in others.

Everyone failed the exams except the dog,
Who got an average of 60, I dont know how he did it.

Over the years, I trained hard on running class,
I skipped swmming, as I was the best at it.

Today, 12 years later, I am proud to say, I passed out
With 44, dog was the highest with 62.

Rabbit passed with 60, pigeon broke few bones, but did pass out.
Fish dropped out, he is doing well though in his own pond.

Little sad I only got 50 in swimming, as I broke my webbed feet
But still the best in swimming class, quacked happily my way out.
