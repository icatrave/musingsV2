Story 2

On a cold winter in suburbs of Seattle, WA, there were swarm of police cars outside a hotel bar. The ambulances were already lined up taking in young kids on a stretcher. The Detective just came in to check on the situation.

Officer: Sir, there were 14 kids in total, all students of UW. And all except one girl, are drugged in their drinks, likely ketamine. We were questioning the bartender and the owner.

Detective: What? except one? who is that?
Officer: That girl over there, she was the one who called us.

Detective: Interesting. (looks at the bartender) What did she drink?
Bartender: She wasnt let in, sir. She is underage.

Detective: Nonsense, arent all these kids underage. Dont act like you dont know that.
Bartender: Sir, we just check for ids, if they are above 18 we let them.

Officer calls that girl for questioning and after all the questions, the Detective looks at her.

Detective: Why didnt you get a fake id? Didnt your friends get one for you too?
The Girl: No, sir. It felt wrong.
